# üß¨ Pathogen-Host Protein Interaction Analysis Pipeline

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing pathogen-host protein interactions using a combination of bioinformatics tools and AlphaFold3. It includes scripts for preprocessing protein sequences, preparing input JSONs for AlphaFold3, running predictions, and summarizing the results.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `prepare_json_from_fa.py`: Prepares JSON files from FASTA sequences for AlphaFold3 multimer predictions.
- `post_analysis.py`: Summarizes AlphaFold3 output by extracting and ranking confidence scores.
- `all_in_one_final.sh`: A full pipeline script that integrates SignalP, OrthoFinder, CD-HIT, AlphaFold3, and post-analysis into a Slurm job.
